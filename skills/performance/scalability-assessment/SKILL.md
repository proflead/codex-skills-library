# Scalability Assessment

## Purpose
Assess a system for growth bottlenecks.

## Inputs to request
- Current throughput and growth projections.
- Architecture and data stores.
- Cost constraints and SLOs.

## Workflow
1. Estimate load characteristics and growth assumptions.
2. Identify bottlenecks in compute, storage, and IO.
3. Propose scaling strategies and cost impacts.

## Output
- Scalability findings and recommendations.

## Quality bar
- Explicitly state assumptions and limits.
- Include cost and operational tradeoffs.
