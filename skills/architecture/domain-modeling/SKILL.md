# Domain Modeling

## Purpose
Model domains and bounded contexts for complex systems.

## Inputs to request
- Business processes and key nouns.
- Existing data models or APIs.
- Known pain points or coupling.

## Workflow
1. Identify core entities and invariants.
2. Define bounded contexts and interfaces.
3. Document event flows and consistency needs.

## Output
- Domain model outline with context boundaries.

## Quality bar
- Keep contexts cohesive and loosely coupled.
- Capture invariants explicitly.
