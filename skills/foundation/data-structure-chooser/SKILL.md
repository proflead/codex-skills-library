# Data Structure Chooser

## Purpose
Recommend basic data structures for a task.

## Inputs to request
- Core operations and their frequency.
- Ordering and uniqueness requirements.
- Expected data size and memory limits.

## Workflow
1. Clarify operations: lookup, insert, iterate, order.
2. Recommend a structure with time/space tradeoffs.
3. Provide a small example usage.

## Output
- Recommendation and rationale.

## Quality bar
- State the complexity assumptions clearly.
- Offer an alternative when tradeoffs are close.
